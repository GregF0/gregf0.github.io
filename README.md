pomodor.app is a progressive web app made to keep you focused. It is based on a time management method called The Pomodoro Technique. Use Pomodor to break down your work into sessions, label them, and get a notification when the each session is over. You can also customize the timer and have an insight into the statistics — find out how much time you spent focused on your work, on which days of the week you were the most productive and exactly how much time you have spent on each label.
